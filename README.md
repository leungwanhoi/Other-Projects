## Gekitai
It is a 2-player board game which is a 3-in-a-row game played on a 6x6 grid.

Game rule:
- Each player has eight coloured pieces and takes a turn placing them anywhere on any open space on the board
- When placed, a piece pushes all adjacent pieces outwards one space if there is an open space for it to move to (or off the board)
- Pieces shoved off the board are returned to the player
The first player who either:
- Lines up three of their colour in a row (horizontal/vertical/diagonal)
- Has all eight of their pieces on the board (also after pushing)
is declared the winner.

Here I used the 2D-array technique in Python to generate this game in practice.


## Web Scraping
It is the process of using bots to extract content and data from a website.
With the 'BeautifulSoup' library in Python, it creates a parse tree for parsed pages that can be used to extract data from HTML.
This skill enables me to collect the bulk of furniture images as training data from the internet fast to perform model training.
